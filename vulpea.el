;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Vulpea is a collection of functions for note taking based on `org'
;; and `org-roam'. In most cases, you should simply load `vulpea'
;; module to get all available functions.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'org-roam)
(require 'vulpea-utils)
(require 'vulpea-buffer)
(require 'vulpea-meta)
(require 'vulpea-select)
(require 'vulpea-db)
