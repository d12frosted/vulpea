A collection of functions for note taking based on =org= and =org-roam=. This
repository goal is to be a tested library for other applications around note
taking. It started as an effort of organising my [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/][Emacs configurations]].

This module contains functions to query notes data base. Functions of interest:

- =vulpea-db-get-file-id= - function to get =ID= of a note represented by =FILE=.
- =vulpea-db-get-file-by-id= - function to get =FILE= of a note represented by
  =ID=. Supports headings of the note.
- =vulpea-db-get-title-by-id= - function to get =TITLE= of a note represented by
  =ID=. Supports headings of the note.
- =vulpea-db-search-by-title= - function to query notes with =TITLE=.

This module contains functions for manipulating note metadata represented by the
first description list in the note, e.g. list like:

#+begin_src org-mode
- key1 :: value1
- key2 :: value21
- key2 :: value22
- key3 :: value3
#+end_src

Functions of interest:

- =vulpea-meta-get= - function to get a value of =PROP= for note with =ID=.
  Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if omitted.
- =vulpea-meta-get-list= - function to get all values of =PROP= for note with
  =ID=. Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if
  omitted.
- =vulpea-meta-set= - function to set =VALUE= of =PROP= for note with =ID=.
  Supports multi-value properties.
- =vulpea-meta-remove= - function to remove a =PROP= for note with =ID=.
- =vulpea-meta-remove= - function to remove all meta for note with =ID=.
