A collection of functions for note taking based on =org= and =org-roam=. This
repository primary goal is to be a tested library for other applications and
utilities around note taking.

Users of this library:

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment][d12frosted/environment]] - Emacs configurations;
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino][d12frosted/vino]] - collection of functions for cellar tracking and wine rating.

* Reasons to use =vulpea=

1. If you are automating things around Org mode files and you want to have a
   tested library to build upon.
2. While =org-roam= was greatly simplified and has adopted some ideas from
   =vulpea= starting from =v2=, it still lacks certain pieces for programmatic
   usage. Just to name few of them:
   1. =vulpea-db-query= is a great interface for quick database search without
      knowing its scheme. In many cases you just want to have a fully
      materialized note instead of a structure that lacks, say tags or aliases.
      So you don't need to write any extra SQL. See [[#performance][Performance]].
   2. =vulpea-select= is a configurable interface for selecting a note with an
      optional filter. Note rendering is controlled by two variables:
      - =vulpea-select-describe-fn= - description of the note (by default
        title).
      - =vulpea-select-annotate-fn= - annotation of the note (by default primary
        title when present and tags) with special face.
   3. =vulpea-create= is a wrapper around =org-roam-capture-= allowing to easily
      provide extra properties, tags and context when creating a new note. And
      most importantly - it returns a newly created note.
3. Several interactive functions:
   1. =vulpea-find= that acts like =org-roam-node-find=, but (a) uses
      =vulpea-select= for consistent experience and (b) allows to set
      =vulpea-find-default-filter=, meaning that you can, for example, list only
      file-level notes by default (which imitates =org-roam= v1 behaviour).
   2. =vulpea-find-backlink= is just a convenient function to find a note
      linking currently opened one. For those who don't want to use =org-roam=
      buffer.
   3. =vulpea-insert= that acts like =org-roam-node-insert=, but (a) uses
      =vulpea-select= for consistent experience, (b) allows to set
      =vulpea-insert-default-filter= (see =vulpea-find= for examples) and (c)
      allows to provide an insertion handler via
      =vulpea-insert-handle-functions=, which is called with inserted note.
4. =vulpea= is more than just a wrapper around =org-roam=, it contains more
   stuff:
   1. Utilities for dealing with buffer properties (e.g. =#+KEY: VALUE=).
   2. Utilities for dealing with [[#metadata][metadata]] (e.g. first description list in the
      buffer).

* Install

=vulpea= is available via [[https://melpa.org/#/vulpea][MELPA]], but you can still install it manually, using
[[https://github.com/raxod502/straight][straight]], [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]], or any other tool.

In short, installation process is simple:

1. Download =vulpea= package via any preferred way.
2. Call =vulpea-db-autosync-enable= (either via adding a hook to
   =org-roam-db-autosync-mode= or directly).
3. If you are using [[#metadata][metadata]], you might need to re-sync =org-roam-db= from
   scratch, e.g. =(org-roam-db-sync 'force)=.

    ;; find out what meta means)
    :hook ((org-roam-db-autosync-mode . vulpea-db-autosync-enable)))
#+end_src

* =vulpea-note=

A note is represented as a =vulpea-note= structure with the following
slots/fields:

- =vulpea-note-id= - =ID= property of note (file-level or heading level).
- =vulpea-note-path= - absolute path to the note (even if the note is actually a heading);
- =vulpea-note-level= - level of the note inside =:path=, with =0= being a
  file-level note and other numbers being a header;
- =vulpea-note-title= - title of the note (it might be an alias);
- =vulpea-note-primary-title= - primary title of the note (present only when
  =title= is an alias);
- =vulpea-note-aliases= - aliases of the note;
- =vulpea-note-links= - list of links, each link being represented as =cons= of
  type and link;
- =vulpea-note-tags= - tags of the note;
- =vulpea-note-meta= - associative list of [[#metadata][metadata]], where key is a string and
  the value is a list of strings. There are also two utilities to access/query
  metadata from note:
  - =vulpea-note-meta-get-list= - to get all values of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.
  - =vulpea-note-meta-get= - to get the first value of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.

If =ID= is not present in the note structure, this note is treated as
non-existent. For example, =vulpea-select= returns such a note, when
=require-match= is =nil= and the user selects non-existent note.

** Mandatory =ID= property

Please note, that each existing =vulpea-note= (!) must contain an =ID= for
Vulpea to be operational. Starting with v2 =org-roam= should cover this, but
another way to always ensure existence of =ID= is to use the following code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun +org-auto-id-add-to-headlines-in-file ()
    "Add ID property to the current file and all its headlines."
    (when (and (or (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
                   (eq major-mode 'org-journal-mode))
               (eq buffer-read-only nil))
      (save-excursion
        (widen)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (org-id-get-create)
        (org-map-entries #'org-id-get-create))))

  (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'+org-auto-id-add-to-headlines-in-file)
#+end_src

* Metadata

In general, metadata is a list of key value pairs that is represented by the
first description list in the note, e.g. list like:

#+begin_src org-mode
- key1 :: value1
- key2 :: value21
- key2 :: value22
- key3 :: value3
#+end_src

It can be manipulated programatically by using functions from either
=vulpea-meta= module or from =vulpea-buffer= module (those prefixed by
=vulpea-buffer-meta=). This data is also persisted in Org roam database for your
convenience and is part of =vulpea-note= returned by =vulpea-db= module. See
respective module documentation to find out all available functions.

Currently metadata is limited to file-level only, e.g. description lists in
outlines are not handled by =vulpea=. Vote for [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/75][vulpea#75]] to bring it faster.

** Why not properties drawer

In many cases, properties are far better choice for storing technical
'metadata', like =ID=, =DATE=, =TAGS=, etc. - something that is not really part
of note content. After all, properties drawer is a drawer:

#+begin_quote
Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally do not want to see it. For this, Org mode has drawers.

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Drawers.html#Drawers][orgmode.org]]
#+end_quote

Of course you can use [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Properties-and-Columns.html#Properties-and-Columns][properties drawer]] to implement simple database
capabilities, but it has one important limitation - values are mere text, so you
can't have real Org mode links there, meaning that [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][Element API]], Org roam and
some other tools *do not* recognise them as links.

Metadata provided by library is just a part of your note content, meaning that
it incorporates well into existing tools. Sure enough it's not as rich as
properties and is not as battle tested as properties, but you can give them a
try.

* Modules

** =vulpea=

This one-stop module contains some generic functions that didn't find their
place in separate modules. It also imports every other module.

Functions of interest:

- =vulpea-find= - select and find a note, a wrapper around =vulpea-select= to
  provide a consistent experience; selection can be narrowed down by
  =vulpea-find-default-filter= or by passing explicit filter; or by changing
  value of =vulpea-find-default-candidates-source=.
- =vulpea-find-backlink= - select and find a backlink to the current note.
- =vulpea-insert= - select a note and insert a link to it. When user selects
  non-existent note, it is captured via =org-roam-capture= process (see
  =org-roam-capture-templates=). Once the link is inserted,
  =vulpea-insert-handle-functions= is called with inserted note as an argument,
  so you can easily perform any necessary post-insertion actions. Selection is
  controlled in a similar way to =vulpea-find= - via global
  =vulpea-insert-default-filter= or local filter.
- =vulpea-create= - function to create a new note file with given =TITLE=,
  =FILE-NAME=, extra =PROPERTIES=, =HEAD=, =BODY= and =CONTEXT=. Returns newly
  created note.

** =vulpea-select=

Module containing =vulpea-select=, =vulpea-select-from= and selection
configuration. =vulpea-select= is a function to =completing-read= a note with
optional filter. =vulpea-select-from= is a function to =completing-read=
arbitrary list of notes. These functions does not use =org-roam= completion
system, as the latter is hard to extend, configure and reuse in broader context.
Display of notes in completion list is defined by =vulpea-select-describe=
function, which by default formats the note in the =title (primary_title)
#space_separated_tags= format, which is controlled by two configurable values:
- =vulpea-select-describe-fn= - description of the note (by default title).
- =vulpea-select-annotate-fn= - annotation of the note (by default primary
  title when present and tags) with special face.

  <p align="center"><em>Narrowing by aliases and tags</em></p>
</div>
#+end_html

** =vulpea-note=

This module contains =vulpea-note= definition and few helpers to access/extract
[[#metadata][metadata]] from =vulpea-note-meta= slot:

- =vulpea-note-meta-get-list= - to get all values of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.
- =vulpea-note-meta-get= - to get the first value of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.

** =vulpea-db=

This module contains functions to query notes data base. In order for most of
these functions to operate, one needs to enable =vulpea-db-autosync-mode= (see
[[#install][Install]] section), for example, using =vulpea-db-autosync-enable=. This hooks
into =org-roam.db= by adding two extra tables:

- =meta= - for storing [[#metadata][Metadata]];
- =notes= - a view table of fully materialized note (see [[#performance][Performance]]).

You might need to perform a full re-sync of =org-roam.db=.

Functions of interest:

- =vulpea-db-query= - function to query notes with generic predicate. This
  function is very powerful as it allows to apply Emacs Lisp predicate on
  /every/ note. This might be not very efficient on big set of notes, in such
  cases use specialized query functions.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-some= - return all notes tagged with one of the
  provided =TAGS=.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-every= - return all notes tagged by every tag from
  the list of provided =TAGS=.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-links-some= - return all notes linking at least one of the
  provided =DESTINATIONS=.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-links-every= - return all notes linking each and every
  provided =DESTINATIONS=.
- =vulpea-db-get-by-id= - function to get note represented by =ID=. Supports
  headings of the note.
- =vulpea-db-get-id-by-file= - function to get =ID= of a note represented by
  =FILE=.
- =vulpea-db-get-file-by-id= - function to get =FILE= of a note represented by
  =ID=. Supports headings of the note.
- =vulpea-db-search-by-title= - function to query notes with =TITLE=.

** =vulpea-meta=

This module contains functions for manipulating note [[#metadata][metadata]] represented by the
first description list in the note, e.g. list like:

#+begin_src org-mode
- key1 :: value1
- key2 :: value21
- key2 :: value22
- key3 :: value3
#+end_src

Functions of interest:

- =vulpea-meta= - function to get metadata from =NOTE-OR-ID=. In most cases you
  should not use this function unless performance is important. In this case,
  take a look at bang functions, e.g. =vulpea-meta-get!=.
- =vulpea-meta-get= - function to get a value of =PROP= for note with =ID=.
  Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if omitted.
- =vulpea-meta-get-list= - function to get all values of =PROP= for note with
  =ID=. Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if omitted.
- =vulpea-meta-set= - function to set =VALUE= of =PROP= for =NOTE-OR-ID=.
  Supports multi-value properties.
- =vulpea-meta-add= - interactive version of =vulpea-meta-set=.
- =vulpea-meta-add-list= - interactive version of =vulpea-meta-set= that
  operates on list values.
- =vulpea-meta-remove= - interactive function to remove a =PROP= for
  =NOTE-OR-ID=.
- =vulpea-meta-clean= - interactive function to remove all meta for
  =NOTE-OR-ID=.

** =vulpea-buffer=

This module contains functions for prop and meta manipulations in current
buffer.

Buffer properties are key-values defined as =#+KEY: VALUE= in the header of
buffer.

Metadata is defined as the first description list in the buffer, e.g. list like:

#+begin_src org-mode
- key1 :: value1
- key2 :: value21
- key2 :: value22
- key3 :: value3
#+end_src

- =vulpea-buffer-title-get= - function to get title of the current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-title-set= - function to set title of the current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-tags-get= - function to get list of tags.
- =vulpea-buffer-tags-set= - function to set/replace the value of =#+filetags=.
- =vulpea-buffer-tags-add= - function to add a tag to =#+filetags=.
- =vulpea-buffer-tags-remove= - function to remove a tag from =#+filetags=.
- =vulpea-buffer-prop-set= - function to set a =VALUE= of property with =NAME=
  in the current buffer, e.g. property in the buffer header using =#+NAME:
  value= format.
- =vulpea-buffer-prop-set-list= - function to set a value of property with
  =NAME= to the list of =VALUES= in the current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-prop-get= - function to get a value of property with =NAME=
  from the current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-prop-get-list= - function to get a value of property with
  =NAME= as a list separated by some =SEPARATORS=.
- =vulpea-buffer-prop-remove= - function to remove a property with =NAME= from
  the current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta= - function to get metadata from current buffer. In most
  cases you should not use this function unless performance is important. In
  this case, take a look at bang functions, e.g. =vulpea-buffer-meta-get!=.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-get= - function to get a value of =PROP= from current
  buffer. Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if omitted.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-get!= - function to get a value of =PROP= from =META=
  (result of =vulpea-buffer-meta=). Value is parsed based on the passed =TYPE=
  or as a string if omitted. Use it performing multiple read operations in a
  row.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-get-list= - function to get all values of =PROP= from
  current buffer. Values are parsed based on the passed =TYPE= or as a string if
  omitted.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-get-list!= - function to get all values of =PROP= from
  =META= (result of =vulpea-buffer-meta=). Values are parsed based on the passed
  =TYPE= or as a string if omitted. Use it performing multiple read operations
  in a row.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-set= - function to set =VALUE= of =PROP= in current
  buffer. Supports multi-value properties.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-remove= - function to remove a =PROP= from current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-clean= - function to remove all meta from current buffer.
- =vulpea-buffer-meta-format= - function to format a =VALUE=.

** =vulpea-utils=

This module contains various utilities used by other modules. Functions of
interest:

- =vulpea-utils-with-note= - function to execute =BODY= with point at =NOTE=.
  Supports file-level notes as well as heading notes.
- =vulpea-utils-link-make-string= - make a bracket link to =NOTE=.
- =vulpea-utils-note-hash= - function to calculate =sha1= of a given =NOTE=.
- =vulpea-utils-collect-while= - utility to repeat some function and collect
  it's results until ~C-g~ is used or passed filter returns =nil=. Example of
  usage - you want to collect multiple values from user and be able to quit the
  process.
- =vulpea-utils-repeat-while= - utility to repeat some function and return first
  unfiltered result. Example of usage - you want to enforce some validation on
  value and keep prompting user until valid value is typed.

* Performance

** Query from database

This library provides multiple functions to query notes from the database.
Basically, there is one powerful =vulpea-db-query= allowing to filter notes by
any =vulpea-note= based predicate. The only downside of this power is
performance and memory penalty as all notes are loaded into memory. In cases
when performance is critical and the set of notes can be narrowed down, one can
use specialized queries:

- =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-some= - return all notes tagged with one of the
  provided =TAGS=.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-every= - return all notes tagged by every tag from
  the list of provided =TAGS=.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-links-some= - return all notes linking at least one of the
  provided =DESTINATIONS=.
- =vulpea-db-query-by-links-every= - return all notes linking each and every
  provided =DESTINATIONS=.

The following table displays time required to query notes by using
=vulpea-db-query= vs specialized query on the database of 9554 [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea-test-notes/][generated notes]].
The difference between various test cases is partially explained by the fact
that filtering functions result in different amount of notes. Since we need to
retrieve full note structure, the more notes we have, the more time it takes.

| test          | result size |            generic |        specialized |
|---------------+-------------+--------------------+--------------------|
| =tags-some=   | 30 notes    |       1.0112478712 |       0.0066033426 |

| =links-every= | 92 notes    |       1.0204833089 |       0.0545313596 |

See [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/discussions/106#discussioncomment-1601429][this comment]] for more background on why these functions where created.

In order to make these functions as fast as possible, =vulpea-db= module builds
and maintains a view table called =notes=. While it does drastically improve
query performance (see the table below), it adds a small footprint on
synchronisation time. See [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/116][vulpea#116]] for more information on this feature and
measurements.

* Coding

Vulpea is developed using [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev/][eldev]]. If you are using =flycheck=, it is advised to
also use [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-eldev][flycheck-eldev]], as it makes dependencies and project files available
thus mitigating false negative results from default Emacs Lisp checker.

* Building and testing

Vulpea tests are written using [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup/][buttercup]] testing framework. And [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev/][eldev]] is used to
run them both locally and on CI. In order to run the tests locally, first
[[https://github.com/doublep/eldev/#installation][install]] =eldev= and then run:

#+begin_src bash
  $ make test
#+end_src

Please note, that the linter is used in this project, so you might want to run
it as well:

#+begin_src bash
  $ make lint
#+end_src
