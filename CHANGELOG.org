This release main feature is dedicate view table to boost performance of query
operations. In addition, it provides some specialized queries for situations
when set of notes can be narrowed down by tags or links.

In addition, =vulpea-note= now has properties, meta and links as part of its
structure.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/97][vulpea#97]] Expose properties in =vulpea-note=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/100][vulpea#100]] Persist note meta in =org-roam-db=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/100][vulpea#100]] Provide an API to access/extract data from =vulpea-note-meta=:
  - =vulpea-note-meta-get-list= - to get all values of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.
  - =vulpea-note-meta-get= - to get the first value of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.
- New function to remove buffer properties - =vulpea-buffer-prop-remove=.
- Improve =filetags= handling:
  - Property format them with =:= as separator;
  - Remove property when setting them to empty list instead of leaving empty
    property.
- New function to select on arbitrary list of notes as opposed to relying on
  filter - =vulpea-select-from=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/discussions/106][vulpea#106]] Include links in =vulpea-note=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/discussions/106][vulpea#106]] Provide more functions to query notes in efficient manner:
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-some= - return all notes tagged with one of the
    provided =TAGS=;
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-every= - return all notes tagged by every tag from
    the list of provided =TAGS=;
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-links-some= - return all notes linking at least one of
    the provided =DESTINATIONS=;
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-links-every= - return all notes linking each and every
    provided =DESTINATIONS=;
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/116][vulpea#116]] improve query performance by building and maintaining a separate
  view table.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/121][vulpea#121]] allow to configure candidates source for =vulpea-find= function via
  =vulpea-find-default-candidates-source= variable.

** v0.2.0

Primarily migration to =org-roam= v2 that has many improvements and breaking
changes.

*Features*

- Allow to provide extra properties in =vulpea-create=.
- New function to manipulate =#+title=: =vulpea-buffer-title-set= and
  =vulpea-buffer-title-get=.
- New functions to manipulate =#+filetags=:
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-get= - function to get list of tags.
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-set= - function to set/replace the value of
    =#+filetags=.
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-add= - function to add a tag to =#+filetags=.
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-remove= - function to remove a tag from =#+filetags=.
- New functions to manipulate buffer-wide properties in the buffer header using
  =#+NAME: value= format:
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-set= - function to set a =VALUE= of property with =NAME=
    in the current buffer.
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-set-list= - function to set a value of property with
    =NAME= to the list of =VALUES= in the current buffer.
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-get= - function to get a value of property with =NAME=
    from the current buffer.
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-get-list= - function to get a value of property with
    =NAME= as a list separated by some =SEPARATORS=.
- Extract buffer related functions (prop and meta related) to separate module.
  Basically, this means that now it's possible to manipulate meta lists that are
  located in any org file, not necessarily part of =vulpea=.
- Add =aliases= and =primary-title= slots to =vulpea-note=.
- Use custom completion in =vulpea-select= instead of one provided by
  =org-roam=. See documentation for more information.
- New functionality to select and find a note:
  - =vulpea-find= - just a wrapper around =vulpea-select= to provide a
    consistent experience; selection can be narrowed down by
    =vulpea-find-default-filter= or by passing explicit filter.
  - =vulpea-find-backlink= - select and find a backlink to current note.
- New functionality to insert a link to the note via =vulpea-insert=, which
  accepts global and local filter (just like =vulpea-find=) and allows to hook
  into finalisation (e.g. call your custom handler after the link was inserted
  regardless involvement of capture process). See documentation for more
  information.
- New utilities to repeat functions:
  - =vulpea-utils-collect-while=;
  - =vulpea-utils-repeat-while=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/98][vulpea#98]] Make it possible to use =vulpea-meta-remove= interactively.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/98][vulpea#98]] Make it possible to use =vulpea-meta-clean= interactively.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/98][vulpea#98]] Provide interactive variant of =vulpea-meta-set=:
  =vulpea-meta-add= and =vulpea-meta-add-list=.
- All features of =org-roam= apply to =vulpea=.

*Breaking changes*

- Flatten template in =vulpea-create=, meaning that instead of passing a
  template in format =(:body :file-name :head :unnarrowed :immediate-finish)=,
  all values should be passed as arguments to =vulpea-create=. Also, there is no
  need to provide =#+title: ${title}= in =:head= anymore. See =vulpea-create=
  documentation for more information.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; instead of
    (vulpea-create title
                   (list :file-name file-name
                         :head "#+title: ${title}\n#+url: ${url}\n#+filetags: tag1 tag2\n"
                         :unnarrowed t
                         :immediate-finish t)
                   (list (cons url "https://example.org")
                         (cons id "xyz")))

    ;; you should
    (vulpea-create title
                   file-name
                   :id xyz
                   :tags '("tag1" "tag2")
                   :head "#+url: ${url}"
                   :unnarrowed t
                   :immediate-finish t
                   :context
                   (list :url "https://example.org"))
  #+end_src
- Remove =vulpea-setup= because =org-roam= v2 already provides all information
  to get resulting file of capture process.
- Remove =vulpea-note-meta=. It was only used for =vulpea-select=, but now it is
  not needed anymore.
- All breaking changes of =org-roam= apply to =vulpea=.

** v0.1.1
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:                     a5682f43-7d2e-47ea-9889-db1ecceb42ef
:END:

Primarily a stabilization and bug-fix release.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/84][vulpea#84]] Support passing extra context for templates to =vulpea-create=. This
  is a /breaking change/, now instead of passing =id= argument, you should pass
  =(list (cons 'id id))=. While being more verbose it gives much more power.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/85][vulpea#85]] Support require match in =vulpea-select=. This is a /breaking
  change/, as arguments to =vulpea-select= are passed as keys. In my experience,
  most of the times first two arguments are =nil= and they are rarely needed. In
  this way, API of this function is cleaner and opens a way to add new
  functionality there.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] New function =vulpea-db-query= to query notes with generic predicate.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] Add metadata to =vulpea-note= consisting of access time and
  modification time.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] Use =vulpea-db-query= in =vulpea-select= instead of heavy
  =org-roam-db-query=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/89][vulpea#89]] =vulpea-utils-note-hash= function to calculate =sha1= of a given
  =NOTE=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/90][vulpea#90]] =vulpea-create= automatically adds a property block with id into
  created file (formatted according to =org-property-format=). This also breaks
  API, see breaking changes section for more information.

*Fixes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/80][vulpea#80]] Fix how =org-roam-capture--new-file= is called from advice.

*Breaking changes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/82][vulpea#82]] Remove all autoloads.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] =vulpea-select= does not allow to pass =completions= anymore.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/87][vulpea#87]] =org-roam-capture--new-file= is not being adviced by default anymore. Instead
  you should call =vulpea-setup=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/90][vulpea#90]] =vulpea-create= does not accept =org-roam-template= (whatever that
  means), instead it accepts a structured property list =(:file-name :head
  :unnarrowed :immediate-finish)= which is converted into something supported by
  =org-roam=. Migration is simple - just remove irrelevant parts.
