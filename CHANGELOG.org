- Include attachment directory in =vulpea-note= and =notes= table.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/130][vulpea#130]] Introduce mechanism to automatically rebuild database when needed. This happens either on the first usage of Vulpea or when =vulpea-db-version= increases.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/158][vulpea#158]] Introduce mechanism to define more tables in Org Roam database (see =vulpea-db-define-table=). And provide a hook to fill defined tables with data (see =vulpea-db-insert-note-functions=).
- Handle forced database sync. Whenever it happens, make sure that all the extra tables are initialized and versions are set accordingly.
- Respect aliases used in the meta blocks when extracting value as a note.
- Introduce =vulpea-insert-default-candidates-source=.
- Introduce =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-none=.
- Include =outline-path= in =vulpea-note= and bump =notes= table version (i.e. a full rebuild is required).
- Introduce =vulpea-db-query-by-level=, which returns all notes of a given =LEVEL=.
- Improve performance of =vulpea-meta-get-list= and =vulpea-note-meta-get-list= for notes by using single call to db.
- Allow to pass meta when creating a new note.
- Allow to control how new note is created when a non-existent one is picked in the insert flow.
- Allow to pass Org capture properties when creating a new note.

** v0.3.0

This release's main feature is a dedicated view table to boost the performance of query operations. In addition, it provides some specialized queries for situations when the set of notes can be narrowed down by tags or links.

In addition, =vulpea-note= now has properties, meta and links as part of its structure.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/97][vulpea#97]] Expose properties in =vulpea-note=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/100][vulpea#100]] Persist note meta in =org-roam-db=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/100][vulpea#100]] Provide an API to access/extract data from =vulpea-note-meta=:
  - =vulpea-note-meta-get-list= - to get all values of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.
  - =vulpea-note-meta-get= - to get the first value of given =PROP= and =TYPE=.
- New function to remove buffer properties - =vulpea-buffer-prop-remove=.
- Improve =filetags= handling:
  - Property format them with =:= as separator;
  - Remove property when setting them to empty list instead of leaving empty property.
- New function to select on arbitrary list of notes as opposed to relying on filter - =vulpea-select-from=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/discussions/106][vulpea#106]] Include links in =vulpea-note=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/discussions/106][vulpea#106]] Provide more functions to query notes in efficient manner:
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-some= - return all notes tagged with one of the provided =TAGS=;
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-tags-every= - return all notes tagged by every tag from the list of provided =TAGS=;
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-links-some= - return all notes linking at least one of the provided =DESTINATIONS=;
  - =vulpea-db-query-by-links-every= - return all notes linking each and every provided =DESTINATIONS=;
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/116][vulpea#116]] improve query performance by building and maintaining a separate view table.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/121][vulpea#121]] allow to configure candidates source for =vulpea-find= function via =vulpea-find-default-candidates-source= variable.
- Add shortcuts for checking tags on the note:
  - =vulpea-note-tagged-all-p= - return non-nil if a NOTE is tagged by all of the TAGS.
  - =vulpea-note-tagged-any-p= - return non-nil if a NOTE is tagged by any of the TAGS.

:END:

Primarily migration to =org-roam= v2 that has many improvements and breaking changes.

*Features*

- Allow to provide extra properties in =vulpea-create=.
- New function to manipulate =#+title=: =vulpea-buffer-title-set= and =vulpea-buffer-title-get=.
- New functions to manipulate =#+filetags=:
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-get= - function to get list of tags.
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-set= - function to set/replace the value of =#+filetags=.
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-add= - function to add a tag to =#+filetags=.
  - =vulpea-buffer-tags-remove= - function to remove a tag from =#+filetags=.
- New functions to manipulate buffer-wide properties in the buffer header using =#+NAME: value= format:
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-set= - function to set a =VALUE= of property with =NAME= in the current buffer.
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-set-list= - function to set a value of property with =NAME= to the list of =VALUES= in the current buffer.
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-get= - function to get a value of property with =NAME= from the current buffer.
  - =vulpea-buffer-prop-get-list= - function to get a value of property with =NAME= as a list separated by some =SEPARATORS=.
- Extract buffer related functions (prop and meta related) to separate module. Basically, this means that now it's possible to manipulate meta lists that are located in any org file, not necessarily part of =vulpea=.
- Add =aliases= and =primary-title= slots to =vulpea-note=.
- Use custom completion in =vulpea-select= instead of one provided by =org-roam=. See documentation for more information.
- New functionality to select and find a note:
  - =vulpea-find= - just a wrapper around =vulpea-select= to provide a consistent experience; selection can be narrowed down by =vulpea-find-default-filter= or by passing explicit filter.
  - =vulpea-find-backlink= - select and find a backlink to current note.
- New functionality to insert a link to the note via =vulpea-insert=, which accepts global and local filter (just like =vulpea-find=) and allows to hook into finalisation (e.g. call your custom handler after the link was inserted regardless involvement of capture process). See documentation for more information.
- New utilities to repeat functions:
  - =vulpea-utils-collect-while=;
  - =vulpea-utils-repeat-while=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/98][vulpea#98]] Make it possible to use =vulpea-meta-remove= interactively.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/98][vulpea#98]] Make it possible to use =vulpea-meta-clean= interactively.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/98][vulpea#98]] Provide interactive variant of =vulpea-meta-set=: =vulpea-meta-add= and =vulpea-meta-add-list=.
- All features of =org-roam= apply to =vulpea=.

*Breaking changes*

- Flatten template in =vulpea-create=, meaning that instead of passing a template in format =(:body :file-name :head :unnarrowed :immediate-finish)=, all values should be passed as arguments to =vulpea-create=. Also, there is no need to provide =#+title: ${title}= in =:head= anymore. See =vulpea-create= documentation for more information.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; instead of
    (vulpea-create title
                   (list :file-name file-name
                         :head "#+title: ${title}\n#+url: ${url}\n#+filetags: tag1 tag2\n"
                         :unnarrowed t
                         :immediate-finish t)
                   (list (cons url "https://example.org")
                         (cons id "xyz")))

    ;; you should
    (vulpea-create title
                   file-name
                   :id xyz
                   :tags '("tag1" "tag2")
                   :head "#+url: ${url}"
                   :unnarrowed t
                   :immediate-finish t
                   :context
                   (list :url "https://example.org"))
  #+end_src
- Remove =vulpea-setup= because =org-roam= v2 already provides all information to get resulting file of capture process.
- Remove =vulpea-note-meta=. It was only used for =vulpea-select=, but now it is not needed anymore.
- All breaking changes of =org-roam= apply to =vulpea=.

:END:

Primarily a stabilization and bug-fix release.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/84][vulpea#84]] Support passing extra context for templates to =vulpea-create=. This is a /breaking change/, now instead of passing =id= argument, you should pass =(list (cons 'id id))=. While being more verbose it gives much more power.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/85][vulpea#85]] Support require match in =vulpea-select=. This is a /breaking change/, as arguments to =vulpea-select= are passed as keys. In my experience, most of the times first two arguments are =nil= and they are rarely needed. In this way, API of this function is cleaner and opens a way to add new functionality there.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] New function =vulpea-db-query= to query notes with generic predicate.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] Add metadata to =vulpea-note= consisting of access time and modification time.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] Use =vulpea-db-query= in =vulpea-select= instead of heavy =org-roam-db-query=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/89][vulpea#89]] =vulpea-utils-note-hash= function to calculate =sha1= of a given =NOTE=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/90][vulpea#90]] =vulpea-create= automatically adds a property block with id into created file (formatted according to =org-property-format=). This also breaks API, see breaking changes section for more information.

*Fixes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/80][vulpea#80]] Fix how =org-roam-capture--new-file= is called from advice.

*Breaking changes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/82][vulpea#82]] Remove all autoloads.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/86][vulpea#86]] =vulpea-select= does not allow to pass =completions= anymore.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/pull/87][vulpea#87]] =org-roam-capture--new-file= is not being adviced by default anymore. Instead you should call =vulpea-setup=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea/issues/90][vulpea#90]] =vulpea-create= does not accept =org-roam-template= (whatever that means), instead it accepts a structured property list =(:file-name :head :unnarrowed :immediate-finish)= which is converted into something supported by =org-roam=. Migration is simple - just remove irrelevant parts.
